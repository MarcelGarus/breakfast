| The Virtual Machine  
|
| Internally, code runs in a stack-based virtual machine (VM), something like a
| mini-computer implemented in software. The VM has its own data stack and call
| stack and operates on instructions (called byte code instructions). From the
| point of view of the VM, Plum types no longer exist. Instead, the instructions
| operate on memory directly, reading from and writing to addresses.
|
| The idea is that instructions and objects live somewhere in memory. We don't
| need to keep track of them, for example by putting them in a List. They just
| float around just like our own data structures â€“ the VM just operates on their
| raw Addresses.
|

|
|   [instruction][instruction][instruction][instruction]
|
|                           [object 3]
|
| Fig 1: objects floating around in memory
|
| The endianness of ints and the stack direction are undefined. Other
| implementations of this byte code are free to chose whatever they want. In
| particular, this means that byte code SHOULD NOT depend on these things. For
| example, you should not push_64(5) and then use pop_8() to pop individual
| bytes.
